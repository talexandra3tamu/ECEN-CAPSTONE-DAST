#Power Subsystem
Talha Zaheer

Goal is to convert 120 VAC from the wall outlet to 12 VDC that will power the Arduino and 2 L298 Stepper Motor Controllers. 
Spent the majority of time in 404 working on the mechanical parts required for construction. I have added a few of the Solidworks drawings as examples.
